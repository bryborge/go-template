# Reporting security vulnerabilities

We value the independent security research community and believe that
responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security
and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you
believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to
[bryborge@gmail.com][1] preferably with a proof of concept.

We ask that you do not use other channels.

Non-vulnerability related security issues including ideas for new or improved
security features are welcome on GitHub Issues.

## Security-related information

We will provide security related information such as a threat model, considerations
for secure use, or any known security issues in our documentation. Please note
that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate a concept and may not be
sufficiently hardened for production use.
